## A3D3: Accelerated AI Algorithms for Data-Driven Discovery 
https://a3d3.ai/ \
The National Science Foundation (NSF), under the Harnessing the Data Revolution (HDR) program, is providing funding to establish the Accelerated AI Algorithms for Data-Driven Discovery (A3D3) Institute, a multi-disciplinary and geographically distributed entity with the primary mission to lead a paradigm shift in the application of real-time artificial intelligence (AI) at scale to advance scientific knowledge and accelerate discovery.

### Hardware and Algorithm Co-development
https://a3d3.ai/activities/hardware-and-algorithm-codevelopment/ \
The Hardware and Algorithm Co-development (HAC) area is dedicated to pioneering novel AI algorithms and hardware support to serve various domain thrusts. Our mission is to craft AI algorithms capable of navigating the complexities of scientific data, addressing issues such as data irregularity, vast data volumes, limited labeling, and the need for robust model generalization during real-time experiments.

## The A3D3 - Science Collaborations

### FastML Lab: Real-time and accelerated ML for fundamental sciences
https://fastmachinelearning.org/ \
Fast ML Lab is a research collective of physicists, engineers, and computer scientists interested in deploying machine learning algorithms for unique and challenging scientific applications. Our projects range from real-time, on-detector and low latency machine learning applications to high-throughput heterogeneous computing big data challenges. 


### CERN Accelerating science
https://home.cern/about/who-we-are/our-mission \
At CERN, our work helps to uncover what the universe is made of and how it works. We do this by providing a unique range of particle accelerator facilities to researchers, to advance the boundaries of human knowledge.

### The ATLAS Experiment
https://atlas.cern/about \
ATLAS is a general-purpose particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is designed to exploit the full discovery potential of the LHC, pushing the frontiers of scientific knowledge. 

### NSF LIGO
https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/about \
The U.S. National Science Foundation Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (NSF LIGO), was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics through the direct detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einsteinâ€™s General Theory of Relativity. 


### Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) 
https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/ \
The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a public-private partnership aimed at a systematic study of the optical night sky. Using an extremely wide-field of view camera, ZTF scans the entire Northern sky every two days. 


### IceCube Overview
https://icecube.wisc.edu/about-us/overview/ \
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is the first detector of its kind, designed to observe the cosmos from deep within the South Pole ice. An international group of scientists responsible for the scientific research makes up the IceCube Collaboration.
